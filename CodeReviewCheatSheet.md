## Documentation
- Code should be self explanatory. Get a feel of story reading, while going through the code. Use appropriate name for variables, functions and classes. If you are taking more time to understand the code, then either code needs refactoring or at least comments have to be written to make it clear.
- Clearly document whet happens with all edge cases.
- Complex algorithms are explained and justified.
- Code that depends on behavior in external libraries is documented with reference to external documentation. if planning to use new/existing libraries we need to understand code behavior completely and document it out.
- Document all test cases that need to be dev tested as part for development process.
